IP ADDRESSES:

1) Based on Addressing Scheme (IPv4 vs. IPv6)
2) Based on Usage (Public vs. Private)
3) Based on Assignment Method (Static vs. Dynamic)

	1_1) IPv4 : It consists of four sets of numbers separated by dots.
	   In most cases, the network part of the address is represented by the first one to
	   three octets, while the remaining section identifies the host (device).
	   
	1_2) IPv6 : created to deal with the shortage of IPv4 addresses. They use 128 bits
	   instead of 32.These addresses are expressed as eight groups of four hexadecimal
	   digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons.  
	    
	2_1) public : 
		Each public IP address is globally unique.
		Devices with a public IP address can be accessed directly from anywhere on the
		internet, assuming no firewall or security settings block the access.    
		Public IP addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
		Public IP addresses can be static (permanently assigned to a device) or dynamic
		(temporarily assigned and can change over time).
		
	2_2) private :
		Private IP addresses are used within private networks and are not routable on
		the internet.This means that devices with private IP addresses cannot directly
		communicate with devices on the internet without a translating mechanism like a
		router performing Network Address Translation (NAT)
		
		Different private networks can use the same range of IP addresses without
		conflict.
		These addresses are used for communication between devices within the same
		network.
		The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved specific IP address
		ranges for private use:
			IPv4: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255,
			192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
   			IPv6: Addresses starting with FD or FC
   			
   	3_1) static :
   		These are permanently assigned to a device, typically important for servers or
   		devices that need a constant address.	
   		Reliable for network services that require regular access such as websites,
   		remote management.
   		
   	3_2) dynamic :
   		Temporarily assigned from a pool of available addresses by the Dynamic Host
   		Configuration Protocol (DHCP).	
   		Cost-effective and efficient for providers, perfect for consumer devices that do
   		not require permanent addresses.
